## Overview :bulb:

The Simple Weather application is a minimal solution for getting accurate weather information without unecessary functionality, that takes away from the core concept. (Which is just providing weather news info). This application is very easy to use and navigate, users of all ages can operate this application. 

As mentioned this is a minimal style weather app, but it has some great features that makes it great for any kind of user. 

Here are the following features:

- Search function that allows the user to input any city of choice for weather information
- Current weather information that is timed and dated
- 5 day forecast for heads planing
- Color coded good, moderate and severe weather for users to easliy identifiy necesarry actions to take
- Clean and minimalistic UI for ease of use! 



## Challenges! :warning:

- Couldn't figure out the search functionality. Experimented with a lot of code but nothing worked

- 5 day forecast was challenging, also didn't get that to work.

## Conslusion :boom:

Still learning, and still trying to grasp all of the concepts of JavaScript and JQuery. But, for the most part things are slowly starting to click, I'm getting some clarity. Definitely getting better with the HTML/CSS, I feel like I'm getting a little bit better, but I know I still have a long way. As, I continue to gain understanding I will revist this project and other to correct and fill in the missing areas, in addition I will reflect on my perspective.
